Sure, here's a classic Jewish joke for you:

Two Jewish men, Moshe and Shlomo, are sitting on a park bench, reading newspapers. Moshe is reading a Jewish newspaper, while Shlomo is reading an anti-Semitic publication.

Moshe looks over and says, "Shlomo, why are you reading that horrible paper?"

Shlomo replies, "When I read our Jewish newspapers, all I see is bad news: anti-Semitism, problems in Israel, and so on. But when I read this anti-Semitic paper, I see that we Jews control the banks, we run the media, and we're all incredibly powerful and successful. It's much more uplifting!"

Hope that brought a smile to your face!
