Sure, here's a classic Jewish joke for you:

Two Jewish men, Moshe and Shlomo, are sitting on a park bench, reading newspapers. Moshe is reading a Jewish newspaper, while Shlomo is reading an anti-Semitic publication.

Moshe looks over and says, "Shlomo, why are you reading that horrible paper?"

Shlomo replies, "When I read our newspapers, all I see is how Jews are persecuted, how anti-Semitism is on the rise, and how things are getting worse. But when I read this paper, it says Jews control the banks, Jews control the media, Jews control everything! I feel so much better!"

Hope that brought a smile to your face!
