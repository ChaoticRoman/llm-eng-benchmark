Creating a full 3D game of Tetris in Python within the constraints of this conversation would be quite challenging and require a significant amount of code. However, I can provide you with a basic outline and some guidance on how you could approach building a 3D Tetris game using Python and a 3D game development library like Pygame or Panda3D.

Here's a high-level outline of the steps involved:

1. Set up the game environment:
   - Choose a 3D game development library (e.g., Pygame, Panda3D).
   - Initialize the game window and set up the 3D rendering context.

2. Define the game elements:
   - Create classes for the Tetris blocks (tetrominoes) with their shapes and colors.
   - Define the game board as a 3D grid.
   - Implement the game logic for block movement, rotation, and collision detection.

3. Handle user input:
   - Capture user input for moving and rotating the blocks.
   - Implement controls for starting, pausing, and restarting the game.

4. Implement game mechanics:
   - Spawn new blocks at the top of the game board.
   - Move the blocks downward automatically and in response to user input.
   - Detect collisions between blocks and the game board.
   - Clear completed rows and update the score.

5. Render the game:
   - Use the chosen 3D library to render the game board and blocks in 3D.
   - Apply textures, lighting, and shading to enhance the visual appearance.
   - Update the game display in real-time based on the game state.

6. Add game features:
   - Implement a scoring system and display the score on the screen.
   - Add levels of increasing difficulty (faster block fall speed).
   - Implement game over conditions and handle game over state.

7. Optimize and refine:
   - Optimize the game performance for smooth gameplay.
   - Fine-tune the game mechanics, controls, and visual effects.
   - Conduct thorough testing and debugging to ensure a stable and enjoyable gaming experience.

Here's a basic code structure to get you started:

```python
import pygame
from pygame.math import Vector3

# Initialize Pygame and set up the game window
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

# Define the Tetris block shapes and colors
# ...

# Define the game board
# ...

# Game loop
while True:
    # Handle user input
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            quit()
        # Handle block movement and rotation based on user input
        # ...

    # Update game state
    # ...

    # Render the game
    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))  # Clear the screen
    # Render the game board and blocks in 3D
    # ...

    pygame.display.flip()  # Update the display
    clock.tick(60)  # Limit the frame rate to 60 FPS
```

This is just a starting point, and you'll need to fill in the details and implement the specific game mechanics and rendering logic based on your chosen 3D library and game design.

Building a complete 3D Tetris game is a substantial project that requires a good understanding of 3D graphics, game development concepts, and the chosen 3D library. I recommend breaking down the project into smaller tasks, researching the specific techniques and libraries needed for each task, and gradually building up the game functionality.
