Yes, there is a problem with the code you provided. The issue lies in the allocation size for the `malloc` function. You are allocating only 1 byte of memory, but you are trying to store a string `"A"` in it, which actually requires 2 bytes: one for the character `'A'` and one for the null terminator `'\0'`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *x = malloc(2); // Allocate 2 bytes of memory
    if (x == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    sprintf(x, "A");
    printf("%s\n", x);
    free(x);
    return 0;
}
```

Changes made:
1. Allocated 2 bytes of memory using `malloc(2)`.
2. Added a check to ensure `malloc` did not return `NULL`, which would indicate a memory allocation failure.
3. Added a newline character `\n` in the `printf` statement for better output formatting.

This ensures that there is enough space to store the string `"A"` along with its null terminator.
