The issue with your code lies in the use of `sprintf()` function. You've allocated only 1 byte of memory for the character pointer `x`, but `sprintf()` tries to write a string into it. In C, strings are null-terminated, meaning they need an extra byte to store the null character `\0`.

So, when you try to write the string "A" into `x`, it's actually trying to write two characters: 'A' and '\0', but there's only space for one. This leads to a buffer overflow, which can cause undefined behavior.

To fix this, you should allocate enough memory to hold the string and the null terminator. Here's the corrected version of your code:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *x = malloc(2); // Allocate 2 bytes: one for 'A' and one for '\0'
    if(x == NULL) {
        printf("Memory allocation failed!\n");
        return 1;
    }
    sprintf(x, "A");
    printf("%s", x);
    free(x);
    return 0;
}
```
Remember to always check if `malloc()` returned `NULL`, indicating that the memory allocation failed.
