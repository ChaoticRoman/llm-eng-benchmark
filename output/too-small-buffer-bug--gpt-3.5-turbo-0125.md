The code is attempting to write the character 'A' into a memory location allocated with `malloc(1)`, which only allocates 1 byte of memory. However, the `sprintf` function writes a null-terminated string, which includes the character 'A' and a null terminator '\0'. This means that the allocated memory is not large enough to hold the string "A\0".

To fix this issue, you should allocate at least 2 bytes of memory to store the character 'A' and the null terminator. Here is the corrected code:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char *x = malloc(2);
    sprintf(x, "A");
    printf("%s", x);
    free(x);
    return 0;
}
```
