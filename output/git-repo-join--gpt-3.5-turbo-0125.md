To join two GitHub repositories including all commits, tags, and branches, you can use the following steps:

1. Clone the first repository to your local machine:
```
git clone <repository1_url>
```

2. Change into the directory of the cloned repository:
```
cd <repository1>
```

3. Add the second repository as a remote:
```
git remote add <remote_name> <repository2_url>
```

4. Fetch all branches and tags from the second repository:
```
git fetch <remote_name>
```

5. Merge the branches from the second repository into the first repository:
```
git merge <remote_name>/<branch_name>
```

6. Repeat step 5 for all branches that you want to merge from the second repository.

7. If there are any conflicts during the merge, resolve them and commit the changes.

8. Push the merged changes to the first repository:
```
git push origin <branch_name>
```

By following these steps, you can join two GitHub repositories including all commits, tags, and branches.
