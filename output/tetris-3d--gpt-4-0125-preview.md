Creating a full 3D Tetris game from scratch in a single response is quite an extensive project, but I can guide you through the basic steps and provide a simplified example to get you started. For a complete 3D game, you would typically use a game engine or a graphics library. In Python, one popular choice is `Pygame` for 2D games, but for 3D, you might consider using `Panda3D`, `PyOpenGL`, or similar.

This example will outline a very basic structure using `PyOpenGL` for rendering, which is a Python binding to OpenGL. OpenGL is widely used for both 2D and 3D graphics programming. Keep in mind, this will be a simplified example focusing on rendering a 3D block that could represent a Tetris piece. For a full game, you would need to expand upon this significantly, including game logic, collision detection, user input, and more.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python installed on your system.**
2. **Install PyOpenGL:** You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
   ```
3. **Install GLFW:** This is a library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing input and events. PyOpenGL does not include windowing features by itself.
   ```
   pip install glfw
   ```

### Basic 3D Rendering Example

This code will create a window and render a simple 3D cube, which could be a starting point for a Tetris block.

```python
import glfw
from OpenGL.GL import *
import OpenGL.GL.shaders
import numpy as np

# Initialize GLFW
if not glfw.init():
    raise Exception("GLFW can't be initialized")

# Creating a window
window = glfw.create_window(720, 600, "3D Tetris Game", None, None)

# Check if window was created
if not window:
    glfw.terminate()
    raise Exception("GLFW window can't be created")

# Set window's position
glfw.set_window_pos(window, 400, 200)

# Make the context current
glfw.make_context_current(window)

# Vertices for a 3D cube
vertices = [
    -0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
     0.5, -0.5, -0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
     0.5,  0.5, -0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
    -0.5,  0.5, -0.5, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0,
    -0.5, -0.5,  0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,
     0.5, -0.5,  0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,
     0.5,  0.5,  0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,
    -0.5,  0.5,  0.5, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0,
]

indices = [
    0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0,
    4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 4,
    4, 5, 1, 1, 0, 4,
    6, 7, 3, 3, 2, 6,
    5, 6, 2, 2, 1, 5,
    7, 4, 0, 0, 3, 7
]

vertices = np.array(vertices, dtype=np.float32)
indices = np.array(indices, dtype=np.uint32)

# Vertex Buffer Object
VBO = glGenBuffers(1)
glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, VBO)
glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vertices.nbytes, vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW)

# Element Buffer Object
EBO = glGenBuffers(1)
glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, EBO)
glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indices.nbytes, indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW)

# Vertex shader
vertex_shader = """
#version 330
layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;
layout (location = 1) in vec3 aColor;
out vec3 ourColor;
void main()
{
    gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0);
    ourColor = aColor;
}
"""
shader = OpenGL.GL.shaders.compileShader(vertex_shader, GL_VERTEX_SHADER)

# Fragment shader
fragment_shader = """
#version 330
in vec3 ourColor;
out vec4 FragColor;
void main()
{
    FragColor = vec4(ourColor, 1.0);
}
"""
shader = OpenGL.GL.shaders.compileShader(fragment_shader, GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER)

# Shader program
program = OpenGL.GL.shaders.compileProgram(shader)

# Linking Vertex Attributes
glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 24, ctypes.c_void_p(0))
glEnableVertexAttribArray(0)
glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 24, ctypes.c_void_p(12))
glEnableVertexAttribArray(1)

glUseProgram(program)

# Main loop
while not glfw.window_should_close(window):
    glfw.poll_events()

    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT)

    # Draw the cube
    glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, len(indices), GL_UNSIGNED_INT, None)

    glfw.swap_buffers(window)

# Terminate GLFW
glfw.terminate()
```

This code is a very basic starting point. To develop a full 3D Tetris game, you would need to:

1. **Implement Game Logic:** Including how Tetris blocks are generated, how they move, and how lines are cleared.
2. **Handle Input:** Allow the player to control the blocks with keyboard inputs.
3. **Add Collision Detection:** To stop blocks when they hit the bottom of the game area or another block.
4. **Develop a User Interface:** Displaying score, next block, and other game information.
5. **Enhance Graphics:** Add textures, lighting, and animations for a more engaging experience.

Creating a 3D game is a complex and rewarding project, and building a game like Tetris is a great way to learn about game development and 3D graphics programming. Good luck!
