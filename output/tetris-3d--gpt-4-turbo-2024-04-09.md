Creating a full 3D Tetris game in Python is a complex project that involves understanding of 3D graphics, game logic, and user interaction. For this, you can use libraries such as `Pygame` for handling game mechanics and `PyOpenGL` or `Panda3D` for 3D graphics. Below, I'll guide you through setting up a basic framework for a 3D Tetris game using `Pygame` and `PyOpenGL`.

### Prerequisites
1. **Python Installation**: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. **Library Installation**: You need to install `pygame` and `PyOpenGL`. You can install these using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
   ```

### Step-by-Step Guide to Start Your 3D Tetris Game

#### Step 1: Setting Up Your Game Window
First, let's set up a basic window using `pygame` and integrate `PyOpenGL` for 3D rendering.

```python
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *
from OpenGL.GL import *
from OpenGL.GLU import *

def main():
    pygame.init()
    display = (800, 600)
    pygame.display.set_mode(display, DOUBLEBUF|OPENGL)
    
    gluPerspective(45, (display[0]/display[1]), 0.1, 50.0)
    glTranslatef(0.0, 0.0, -5)

    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                quit()

        glRotatef(1, 3, 1, 1)
        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT|GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
        Cube()
        pygame.display.flip()
        pygame.time.wait(10)

def Cube():
    vertices= (
        (1, -1, -1),
        (1, 1, -1),
        (-1, 1, -1),
        (-1, -1, -1),
        (1, -1, 1),
        (1, 1, 1),
        (-1, -1, 1),
        (-1, 1, 1)
    )
    edges = (
        (0,1),
        (1,2),
        (2,3),
        (3,0),
        (4,5),
        (5,6),
        (6,7),
        (7,4),
        (0,4),
        (1,5),
        (2,6),
        (3,7)
    )

    glBegin(GL_LINES)
    for edge in edges:
        for vertex in edge:
            glVertex3fv(vertices[vertex])
    glEnd()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Step 2: Understanding the Code
- **OpenGL Setup**: We set up a perspective view and move the camera back a bit.
- **Game Loop**: The game loop handles events and updates the display.
- **Cube Function**: This function draws a simple cube using vertices and edges.

#### Step 3: Expanding to Tetris
To create a full Tetris game:
1. **Game Logic**: Implement the logic for handling different Tetris pieces, their rotation, and movement.
2. **Collision Detection**: Add logic to detect when a piece should stop moving down and when lines are completed.
3. **User Input**: Handle user inputs to move and rotate pieces.

#### Step 4: Rendering Tetris Pieces
You would need to modify the `Cube` function to render different types of Tetris pieces in 3D. Each piece type can be represented as a combination of cubes.

#### Step 5: Completing the Game
- Add scoring, levels, and line clearing.
- Implement a game over condition.
- Enhance the user interface and possibly add sound.

### Conclusion
This setup gives you a basic 3D environment with a rotating cube. Expanding this into a full 3D Tetris game requires substantial additional work, particularly in game logic and rendering Tetris pieces. This project is excellent for learning more about 3D programming in Python and game development principles.
