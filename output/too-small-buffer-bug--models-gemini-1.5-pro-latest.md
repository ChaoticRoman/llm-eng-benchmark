The issue lies in the use of `sprintf` after allocating only one byte of memory with `malloc`. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Memory Allocation:** `malloc(1)` allocates a single byte of memory and assigns its address to the character pointer `x`.

2. **String Formatting:** `sprintf(x, "A");` attempts to write the character 'A' followed by a null terminator '\0' into the memory pointed to by `x`. Since strings in C are null-terminated, you need space for both the character and the null terminator.

3. **Buffer Overflow:**  Because you only allocated one byte, `sprintf` writes beyond the allocated memory, resulting in a buffer overflow. This is undefined behavior and can lead to program crashes or security vulnerabilities.

**How to fix it:**

To resolve this issue, allocate enough memory to accommodate the string and its null terminator:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // Allocate space for "A" and the null terminator
    char *x = malloc(2); 

    if (x == NULL) {
        // Handle allocation failure
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }

    sprintf(x, "A");
    printf("%s", x);
    free(x);
    return 0;
}
```

**Safer Alternatives:**

* **`snprintf`:** This function allows you to specify the maximum number of characters to write, preventing buffer overflows. Example: `snprintf(x, 2, "A");` 
* **`asprintf`:** This function allocates the necessary memory automatically. You'll need to free the allocated memory using `free`. Example: `char *x; asprintf(&x, "A"); ... free(x);`

By using these safer alternatives or ensuring you allocate sufficient memory, you can avoid buffer overflows and write more secure C code.
