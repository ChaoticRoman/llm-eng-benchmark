Creating a 3D version of Tetris in Python is a complex task that involves understanding 3D graphics, game logic, and user input handling. Below is a simplified version of how you might start building such a game using the `pygame` library for handling the game loop and user input, and `pyopengl` for rendering 3D graphics.

First, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed:
```sh
pip install pygame PyOpenGL
```

Here's a basic outline of how you might structure your 3D Tetris game:

1. **Initialize Pygame and OpenGL**: Set up the game window and initialize OpenGL for 3D rendering.
2. **Define the Tetris Blocks**: Create the 3D shapes for the Tetris blocks.
3. **Game Logic**: Implement the game logic for moving and rotating the blocks.
4. **Rendering**: Render the blocks in 3D space.
5. **User Input**: Handle user input for moving and rotating the blocks.

Below is a simplified example to get you started:

```python
import pygame
from pygame.locals import *
from OpenGL.GL import *
from OpenGL.GLU import *
import numpy as np

# Define the vertices and edges of a cube (basic Tetris block)
vertices = [
    (1, 1, -1),
    (1, -1, -1),
    (-1, -1, -1),
    (-1, 1, -1),
    (1, 1, 1),
    (1, -1, 1),
    (-1, -1, 1),
    (-1, 1, 1)
]

edges = [
    (0, 1),
    (1, 2),
    (2, 3),
    (3, 0),
    (4, 5),
    (5, 6),
    (6, 7),
    (7, 4),
    (0, 4),
    (1, 5),
    (2, 6),
    (3, 7)
]

def draw_cube():
    glBegin(GL_LINES)
    for edge in edges:
        for vertex in edge:
            glVertex3fv(vertices[vertex])
    glEnd()

def main():
    pygame.init()
    display = (800, 600)
    pygame.display.set_mode(display, DOUBLEBUF | OPENGL)
    gluPerspective(45, (display[0] / display[1]), 0.1, 50.0)
    glTranslatef(0.0, 0.0, -5)

    clock = pygame.time.Clock()
    while True:
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                quit()

        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:
            glTranslatef(-0.1, 0, 0)
        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:
            glTranslatef(0.1, 0, 0)
        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:
            glTranslatef(0, 0.1, 0)
        if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:
            glTranslatef(0, -0.1, 0)
        if keys[pygame.K_q]:
            glRotatef(1, 0, 1, 0)
        if keys[pygame.K_e]:
            glRotatef(-1, 0, 1, 0)

        glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)
        draw_cube()
        pygame.display.flip()
        clock.tick(60)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Vertices and Edges**: We define the vertices and edges of a cube, which will be our basic Tetris block.
2. **draw_cube()**: This function draws the cube using the vertices and edges.
3. **main()**: This is the main game loop where we initialize Pygame and OpenGL, handle user input, and render the cube.

### Next Steps:
1. **Tetris Blocks**: Define the different Tetris shapes (tetrominoes) using combinations of cubes.
2. **Game Logic**: Implement the logic for moving, rotating, and placing the blocks, as well as clearing completed layers.
3. **Collision Detection**: Implement collision detection to prevent blocks from overlapping or moving out of bounds.
4. **Scoring and Levels**: Add scoring and level progression.

This example is a starting point and lacks many features of a complete Tetris game, but it should give you a foundation to build upon.
