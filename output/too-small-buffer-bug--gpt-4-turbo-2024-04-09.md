The code you've provided is mostly correct, but it has a subtle issue that could potentially lead to undefined behavior. Here's a breakdown of the code and the potential problem:

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   ```c
   char *x = malloc(1);
   ```
   Here, you allocate memory for a single character.

2. **Writing to the Allocated Memory**:
   ```c
   sprintf(x, "A");
   ```
   The `sprintf` function is used to write the string "A" into the memory pointed to by `x`. The string "A" consists of the character 'A' followed by a null terminator (`'\0'`). This means you need space for two characters, not just one.

3. **Printing the String**:
   ```c
   printf("%s", x);
   ```
   This line prints the string stored at the memory location pointed to by `x`. Since `sprintf` automatically adds a null terminator, this should work correctly if there was enough space allocated.

4. **Freeing the Memory**:
   ```c
   free(x);
   ```
   This correctly frees the memory allocated at the beginning of the program.

### Issue in the Code

The main issue with the code is that the memory allocation does not account for the null terminator. When you use `sprintf` to write "A" into `x`, two characters are written: 'A' and `'\0'`. However, you've only allocated memory for one character. This results in writing beyond the allocated memory, which is undefined behavior.

### Solution

To fix the issue, you should allocate at least 2 bytes of memory to safely store the string "A" along with its null terminator:

```c
char *x = malloc(2);  // Allocate memory for 'A' and '\0'
if (x == NULL) {
    perror("Failed to allocate memory");
    return EXIT_FAILURE;
}
sprintf(x, "A");
printf("%s", x);
free(x);
```

Additionally, it's a good practice to check if `malloc` returns `NULL`, which indicates that the memory allocation failed. This can prevent dereferencing a NULL pointer and causing the program to crash.
