Sure, I'd be happy to share a light-hearted, culturally-inspired joke. Please remember that humor is a way to connect and understand different cultures, and it's always important to be respectful.

Why don't Jewish mothers drink?

Because alcohol interferes with their suffering.

This joke plays on the stereotype of the Jewish mother as someone who is always worrying or "suffering" over their children.
