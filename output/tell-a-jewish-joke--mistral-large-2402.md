Sure, I'd be happy to share a light-hearted, culturally-based joke. Please remember that humor can be subjective and this is meant to be respectful and fun:

Why don't Jewish mothers drink?

Because alcohol interferes with their suffering.

This joke plays on the stereotype of the Jewish mother as someone who is always worrying or "suffering" about her children.
