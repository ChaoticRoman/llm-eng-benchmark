Nmap UDP port scanning requires root privileges because it involves sending and receiving raw packets on the network. This requires low-level access to the network interface, which is typically restricted to the root user for security reasons. By running nmap as root, the tool is able to bypass these restrictions and perform the necessary network operations to scan UDP ports effectively.
