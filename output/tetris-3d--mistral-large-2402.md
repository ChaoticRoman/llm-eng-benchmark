Creating a full 3D Tetris game in Python is a complex task that would require a lot of code and time. However, I can guide you through the basic steps and provide you with some resources to get started.

1. **Choose a Python 3D Library**: There are several libraries you can use to create 3D games in Python, such as Pygame, Panda3D, and PyOpenGL. For a Tetris game, Pygame could be a good starting point as it's relatively easy to learn and has good documentation.

2. **Understand the Tetris Game Logic**: Before you start coding, you should understand how Tetris works. This includes the different shapes (Tetriminos), how they rotate, the game grid, scoring, and game over conditions.

3. **Create the 3D Game Board**: Using your chosen library, you'll need to create a 3D game board. This will likely involve creating a grid of cubes.

4. **Create the Tetriminos**: These are the shapes that fall down the board. You'll need to create each shape and make sure they can rotate in 3D.

5. **Implement the Game Logic**: This includes making the shapes fall, detecting when a line is full and should disappear, and detecting when the game is over.

6. **Add User Input**: You'll need to allow the player to rotate the shapes and move them left and right.

7. **Polish the Game**: This could include adding a scoring system, creating a menu, and adding sound effects.

Remember, creating a game is a big project, so don't get discouraged if it takes a while. Start small and gradually add more features. Good luck!
