To join two GitHub repositories while preserving all commits, tags, and branches, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone both repositories to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository1_url>
   git clone <repository2_url>
   ```

2. Create a new empty repository on GitHub where you want to join the two repositories.

3. Clone the new empty repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <new_repository_url>
   ```

4. Navigate to the newly cloned repository:
   ```
   cd <new_repository>
   ```

5. Add the first repository as a remote to the new repository:
   ```
   git remote add repo1 <repository1_url>
   ```

6. Fetch all the branches and tags from the first repository:
   ```
   git fetch repo1
   ```

7. Merge the branches and tags from the first repository into the new repository:
   ```
   git merge repo1/main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```
   Note: Replace `main` with the appropriate branch name if it differs.

8. Repeat steps 5-7 for the second repository:
   ```
   git remote add repo2 <repository2_url>
   git fetch repo2
   git merge repo2/main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```

9. Push the merged repository to the new GitHub repository:
   ```
   git push origin --all
   git push origin --tags
   ```

After following these steps, the new GitHub repository will contain all the commits, tags, and branches from both the original repositories.

Please note that merging unrelated histories may result in conflicts that need to be resolved manually. Make sure to carefully review and resolve any conflicts that arise during the merging process.

Also, ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create a new repository and push changes to it on GitHub.
