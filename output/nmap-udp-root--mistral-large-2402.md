The reason why NMAP UDP port scan requires root privileges is due to how UDP scans work and the way operating systems handle network packets.

In a TCP scan, the scanner can rely on the operating system to handle the details of the TCP three-way handshake and report back which ports are open. However, UDP is a connectionless protocol, which means there's no handshake to initiate a connection. This makes it harder to determine if a UDP port is open, as there's no guaranteed response from the target machine.

To perform a UDP scan, NMAP sends a UDP packet to each targeted port and waits for a response. If there's no response, it re-sends the packets a certain number of times, then assumes the port is open if there's still no response. However, to send and receive these packets directly, NMAP needs to create and manage raw sockets, which requires root (or administrator) privileges on most operating systems.

This is because creating raw sockets allows a program to send and receive any kind of packet directly, bypassing the normal protocol handling of the operating system. This can potentially be used for malicious purposes, such as sending spoofed or malformed packets, so it's restricted to root users for security reasons.

Therefore, to perform a UDP scan with NMAP, you need to have root privileges to create and manage these raw sockets.
