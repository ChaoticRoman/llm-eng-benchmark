Debye shielding is a phenomenon in plasma physics where charged particles in a plasma are shielded from the electric fields of other charged particles by surrounding neutralizing particles. This shielding effect is due to the presence of mobile charged particles in the plasma, such as electrons and ions, which can move in response to the electric fields created by other charged particles.

The Debye length, named after physicist Peter Debye, is a measure of the distance over which the electric field of a charged particle in a plasma is shielded by the surrounding neutralizing particles. As the distance from a charged particle increases beyond the Debye length, the electric field strength decreases exponentially, leading to a rapid decrease in the influence of the charged particle on its surroundings.

Debye shielding plays a crucial role in the behavior of plasmas, influencing phenomena such as wave propagation, particle interactions, and plasma instabilities. Understanding and accounting for Debye shielding effects is essential for accurately modeling and predicting the behavior of plasmas in various applications, such as fusion research, space physics, and industrial plasma processing.
