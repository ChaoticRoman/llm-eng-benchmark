To implement the described sorting algorithm and its accompanying documentation and unit tests, we will follow these steps:

1. **Algorithm Implementation**: We will create a function named `sortWithReversals` that takes a vector of integers and returns a vector of integers representing the lengths of the prefixes of the array to be reversed in order to sort the array.

2. **Documentation**: We will document the function, explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value.

3. **Unit Tests**: We will write a simple test suite using assertions to verify that our function works as expected for various input cases.

### 1. Algorithm Implementation

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

std::vector<int> sortWithReversals(const std::vector<int>& input) {
    std::vector<int> result;
    std::vector<int> arr = input; // Copy input to a modifiable array
    int n = arr.size();
    
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
        // Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array
        auto minIt = std::min_element(arr.begin() + i, arr.end());
        int minIndex = std::distance(arr.begin(), minIt);
        
        // If the minimum element is not in its correct position, reverse the subarray
        if (minIndex != i) {
            std::reverse(arr.begin() + i, arr.begin() + minIndex + 1);
            result.push_back(minIndex + 1); // Store the length of the reversed prefix
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### 2. Documentation

```cpp
/**
 * Sorts an array by repeatedly reversing the order of the first several elements.
 * 
 * This function takes a vector of integers and returns a vector of integers representing
 * the lengths of the prefixes of the array that need to be reversed in order to sort the array.
 * 
 * @param input A vector of integers to be sorted.
 * @return A vector of integers where each integer represents the length of the prefix of the
 *         array that was reversed during the sorting process.
 */
```

### 3. Unit Tests

For unit testing, we will use simple assertions since a more sophisticated testing framework is not specified. In a real-world scenario, a testing framework like Google Test would be preferable.

```cpp
#include <cassert>

void testSortWithReversals() {
    // Test case 1
    {
        std::vector<int> input = {12, 13, 11, 14};
        std::vector<int> expected = {2, 3};
        assert(sortWithReversals(input) == expected);
    }
    
    // Test case 2
    {
        std::vector<int> input = {4, 3, 2, 1};
        std::vector<int> expected = {4};
        assert(sortWithReversals(input) == expected);
    }
    
    // Test case 3
    {
        std::vector<int> input = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        std::vector<int> expected = {}; // Already sorted
        assert(sortWithReversals(input) == expected);
    }
    
    // Test case 4
    {
        std::vector<int> input = {3, 1, 2};
        std::vector<int> expected = {3, 2};
        assert(sortWithReversals(input) == expected);
    }
    
    std::cout << "All tests passed!" << std::endl;
}

int main() {
    testSortWithReversals();
    return 0;
}
```

This code provides a basic implementation of the sorting algorithm described, along with documentation and a simple set of unit tests to verify its correctness. Remember, the effectiveness and efficiency of this sorting algorithm are limited, and it's more of an academic or puzzle exercise than a practical sorting solution.
